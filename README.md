# notes

This is a collation of all the notes I've made / I'll be making for topics in DSA.
 You can use this as a _resource for your prep_ :)
 
 In the first, you can find links to questions from different sources so that you can quickly go through them and see which ones suit your style the best. 
 I hope this helps you! 
 :)
 
 
 
 This is an on-going process, so please bare with any delay in the updates for the notes.
